      SaintsXCTF was created during my time running Cross Country & Track at St. Lawrence University. The team needed a training log where coaches and athletes could view and comment on each others workouts. A shared logging platform was especially useful during summer training when the team was apart.

      SaintsXCTF has become a sophisticated exercise logging platform, accessible from the web and mobile devices. I hope SaintsXCTF is a useful and fun tool for your teams needs.
